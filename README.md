Updates original Mark 1 devices so they can upgrade to the latest version of Mycroft.

## About 
Some of the earliest shipping Mark 1 devices require this platform patch in order to begin automatically updating.  

You can tell if you need the patch by following this guide:

```
Hey Mycroft, install version checker
"Attempting to install"
```
(wait a minute)
```
Hey Mycroft, what version are you running?
"I'm runing mycroft-core version 0.8.19"
```
If your version is less than 0.9.0, you should install this platform patch.
